# Domain Messaging Overview

You can use your UD domains for private email communication by enabling email messaging for your domain, setting up a forwarding address, and sharing your new email address with the world. We call this **Unstoppable email**!

## Configure Your Private Email Address

Navigate to your domain's profile management page and enter the email address you'd like to receive forwarded messages. You can
change the forwarding email address at any time.

## Disabled by Default

We value your privacy, so the Unstoppable email feature is disabled by default. If you want to use Unstoppable email, navigate
to the email tab on your domain profile management page. Toggle the enable switch to turn the feature on/off at any time.

## Your Contact Information Is Safe

Unstoppable email uses an email proxy service to exchange messages for your domain's `@ud.me` address. External users can contact you using `yourdomain@ud.me`, and we forward the message to your email address. We also hide your email address if you respond to an Unstoppable email message to keep your identity safe.

:::info
Your private email address stays private. Messages will appear as `yourdomain@ud.me` when you respond to an Unstoppable email.

## You Can Use Your Standard Email Client

When an Unstoppable email is forwarded to your private email address, it will appear in your standard email client. Every message includes a footer with the name of your Unstoppable Domain and a link to block future messages from the sender.

:::info
Be careful that you may include your phone number, address, and other personal information in an email signature. We can hide your email address but cannot change the information contained in your message.
