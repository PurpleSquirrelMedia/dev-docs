Every Unstoppable Domain can be used for private email communication. Unstoppable email! Simply enable email messaging
for your domain, set up your forwarding address, and share your new email address with the world.

## Disabled by default

We value your privacy, so the Unstoppable email feature is disabled by default. If you want to use Unstoppable email, navigate

## Keep your contact information safe

Unstoppable email uses an email proxy service to exchange messages for your domain's @ud.me address. External users can contact you using
yourdomain@ud.me and we forward the message to your personal email address. If you choose to respond to an Unstoppable email message, 
we hide your personal email addess to keep your identity safe.

## Configure your private email address

Navigate to your domain's profile management page and enter the email address you'd like to receive forwarded messages. You can
change the forwarding email address at any time.

## Use your standard email client

a footer with the name of your Unstoppable Domain, and also includes a link to block future messages from the sender.
